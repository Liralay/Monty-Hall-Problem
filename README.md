# Monty-Hall-Problem

There are some problems in statistics where even if you know all the theory you would still not believe how it is possible. (For me at least thats a thing). 

Thats why I like to run experements for such problems to see the actual results of the problem. 

For me it was really difficult to understand The Monty Hall Problem, where the Show-host asks you to pick one of three doors. Behind one of the doors is a new car and behind the others are goats.
For example you pick door number 1. And Show-host opens the door number 2 and shows to you that behind door number 2 is actually a goat. Now he offers you to switch your choise and pick door number 3.
Should you do it?

Base on the statistics - yes. You should switch. And my program shows it by a really illustrative example. It runs a bunch of games and shows you the total resullts of them all.
Spearing the ditales, here are the results of 10.000 games played:

 |     Wins: 3305, Loses: 6695 if you don't switch. Winrate: 33% 

 |     Wins: 6695, Loses: 3305 if you switch. Winrate: 66%
